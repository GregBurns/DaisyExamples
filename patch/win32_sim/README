This is a Daisy Patch simulator that runs on windows. It is a self contained windows command line application that displays a windows simulating the OLE display, the analog control inputs, and the two gate input. The mouse scroll button is mapped to encoder forward/backward, the left and middle mouse buttons both map the encode push button.

The simulator uses libsndfile, an open source sound library and requires the libsndfile-1.dll to be in a folder on the binary search PATH or in the folder the application is launched from. The application builds in 32 bit mode for consistency with the patch hardware.

The simulator can take audio input from a .wav file and also has a built-in waveform generator. The .wav files can be mono or stereo, a mono input is duplicated to all input channels, stereo L/R is duplicated to channels 3/4. The waveform generator is duplicated to all input channels. When input is from a .wav file the sample rate is fixed at the sample rate in the file, otherwise all the path sample rates are available. There is a looping option for the .wav file which is useful when the .wav file is just a single note.
